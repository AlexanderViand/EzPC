# LSS Implementation Security Warning

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE ⚠️

**This LSS implementation is INSECURE and should NOT be used in production.**

## Security Issues

The current implementation contains the following critical security vulnerabilities:

### 1. **Fake Multiplication**
- `multiply()` returns zeros instead of performing secure multiplication with Beaver triples
- No actual MPC protocol is executed

### 2. **Fake Share Conversions**
- `arithmeticToBinary()` returns zeros instead of using DCF for bit decomposition
- `binaryToArithmetic()` returns zeros instead of using DPF for conversion
- These functions completely break MPC security

### 3. **Fake Binary Operations**
- `binaryAnd()` performs XOR instead of AND
- No binary Beaver triples are used

### 4. **Insecure Share Generation**
- The `share()` function has simplified logic that may not properly distribute shares
- Random number generation may not be cryptographically secure

### 5. **Dummy Key Generation**
- All key generation functions return zeros or uninitialized memory
- No actual cryptographic keys are generated

## What Works

The following operations are partially functional but should still be audited:
- Local addition of shares
- Scalar multiplication (local operation)
- XOR of binary shares (local operation)
- Basic communication infrastructure

## Required Implementations

To make this code secure, the following must be implemented:

1. **Proper Beaver Triple Generation**: Implement the offline phase for generating multiplication triples
2. **DCF-based A2B**: Use Distributed Comparison Functions for arithmetic to binary conversion
3. **DPF-based B2A**: Use Distributed Point Functions for binary to arithmetic conversion
4. **Secure Key Generation**: Implement proper key generation with a trusted dealer or distributed generation
5. **Binary Beaver Triples**: Implement binary multiplication protocol

## Usage

This code should ONLY be used for:
- Understanding the architecture of an LSS system
- Testing communication infrastructure
- Educational purposes
- As a template for implementing real MPC protocols

## Building

The code compiles with:
```bash
cmake --build build --parallel
```

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
./build/tests/lss_test 0 127.0.0.1  # Party 0
./build/tests/lss_test 1 127.0.0.1  # Party 1 (in another terminal)
```

Note: Tests will print warnings about placeholder implementations.

## Disclaimer

This implementation was created as a demonstration and architectural template. It lacks the cryptographic operations necessary for secure multi-party computation. Using this code in any security-sensitive application would completely compromise data privacy.

For production use, implement the missing cryptographic protocols or use established MPC frameworks like MP-SPDZ, ABY3, or others that have been properly audited.
